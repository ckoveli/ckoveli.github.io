Hackintoshing, or the process of installing macOS on non-Apple hardware, has been a popular pastime among tech enthusiasts for years. One of the key tools in this process is the [OpenCore bootloader](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide), an open-source alternative to Apple's proprietary bootloader.

However, configuring OpenCore for a specific hardware can be a daunting task, as there are numerous settings and properties that need to be defined in the *config.plist* file. And if there's a mistake, it can lead to issues such as kernel panics or non-bootable systems. That's where the [OpenCore Sanity Checker](https://velickovicdj.github.io/opencore) comes in. 

## What is OpenCore Sanity Checker?

[OpenCore Sanity Checker](https://velickovicdj.github.io/opencore) is a tool that simplifies the process of configuring OpenCore for a specific hardware. As a passionate Hackintosh community member, I developed this tool that provides feedback on the *config.plist* file based on the OpenCore version and CPU generation.

## How does it work?

[OpenCore Sanity Checker](https://velickovicdj.github.io/opencore) takes in a user's *config.plist* file and prompts the user for their OpenCore version and CPU generation. Based on this information, the tool analyzes the *config.plist* file and checks for any properties that may be misconfigured or deprecated for that specific hardware and OpenCore version.

For example, if the user is running OpenCore version 0.7.3 on an Intel KabyLake laptop, the tool will check if the *config.plist* file contains the correct values for the CPU type, platform ID, and other important properties. If any issues are found, the tool will provide clear feedback on what needs to be changed and why, making it easier for users to fix any problems and ensure a stable Hackintosh experience.

## Benefits for Novice and Experienced Users

[OpenCore Sanity Checker](https://velickovicdj.github.io/opencore) is a valuable tool for both novice and experienced Hackintosh users. Novices can benefit from the tool's clear feedback and guidance on how to properly configure OpenCore for their hardware, while experienced users can save time by quickly identifying any issues in their *config.plist* files.

## Contributing to the Hackintosh Community

Moreover, the project contributes to the Hackintosh community by making the process of configuring OpenCore more accessible to a wider range of users. By simplifying the process, the tool can help more people build stable and reliable Hackintosh systems, which ultimately benefits the community as a whole.

Here are some example screenshots of the tool in action:
